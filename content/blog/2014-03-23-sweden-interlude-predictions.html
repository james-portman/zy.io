<p>Probably going to be without Internet til we reach somewhere near the end now, so rather than make up 7 days of Swedish adventure and set them to auto post, I'll just make a series of predictions. Predictions that I either believe will come true, want to come true, or just things that I think are funny.</p>
<li>it's going to be damn cold</li>
<li>this is the last bit of luxury I'll see for a while</li>
<li>I'll run out of books in about three days time and wish I bought more whilst I still had Internet </li>
<li>the snowshoes will be a terrible idea</li>
<li>Jon will be eaten by a grue</li>
<li>Jon will be as laid back about this as he is everything else</li>
<li>I'll have trouble explaining to the local police what a grue is</li>
<li>everything will have dairy in it, I just won't know what it's called</li>
<li>all my pictures will be massively over exposed due to all the snow</li>
<li>we'll discover that renting a dog sled is cheaper than renting snow shoes</li>
<li>I'll be forced to try some form of pickled fish</li>
<li>Jon will find some salt liquorice and try and make me eat some</li>
<li>I'll grow a glorious beard due to 6 days not shaving</li>
<li>we'll manage to not see the northern lights, despite us bring in the best place in the world to do so</li>
<li>I'll make another pointless list</li>
<p>I'll come back to this when I find some more internet. Feel free to make your own guesses about our trip, let's see what happens.</p>
