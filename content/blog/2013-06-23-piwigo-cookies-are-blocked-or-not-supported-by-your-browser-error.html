<p>"Cookies are blocked or not supported by your browser. You must enable cookies to connect."</p>
<p>Just been beating my head against the wall on this one.</p>
<p>Checking it wasn't browser</p>
<p>fiddled with php session/cookie settings</p>
<p>switched from apache to nginx</p>
<p>changed from files to memcache for session handler</p>
<p>realised it didn't happen when I went to pics.zy.io:6694</p>
<p>switched return(pass) to return(pipe)</p>
<p>all is well</p>
