<p>It turns out yesterday ended with us at a lower altitude than we started at, so today was the start of our slog up the mountains. We gained about 900 vertical metres over the course of a 7+ hour hike up to Namche, so it was really quite steep in parts. </p>
<p>As with yesterday, it's really quite warm whilst the sun is out, but the temperature drops to single figures as soon as it gets a bit dark.</p>
<p>We're now at the point where altitude sickness becomes a bit of a concern. Various members of the group are already feeling it a bit, may be time to turn to the Diamox if I get any symptoms. The Sherpas reckon that the best thing to do to combat it is to eat garlic soup, but whilst it is tasty, I doubt it's pharmaceutical benefits. </p>
<p>As we're at about 3500m now, tomorrow is a rest day. They seem to have a funny idea of rest though, as it entails a 4-5 hour walk with a 400m ascent. Daal bhat count is now at three for three, so I'm keeping strong in that respect.</p>
<p>May find some Internet soon so that I can upload this backlog of posts, shall see what tomorrow brings.</p>
