<p>Had to wake up horrendously early today for our 5am start to ascend Kala Patthar. It was a 3 hour round trip in total, including the usual photo taking at the summit.</p>
<p>Managed to make pretty good time, successfully back in time for breakfast. Not bad to say it was a 400 metre ascent to our highest point of the trip.</p>
<p>Now to start the journey back.</p>
