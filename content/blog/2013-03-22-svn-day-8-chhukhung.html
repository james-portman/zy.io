<p>Our stop at Dingboche is another acclimatisation day. They seemed to have stopped calling them rest days now, after realising that a haul up to 4800 metres isn't most people's idea of a rest.</p>
<p>Today was spent walking to Chhukhung, which was our highest (and also coldest) point sp far. Giving us some excellent views of a big chunk of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>Whilst a few members of the group are now really feeling the effects of AMS, two more have gone the opposite way. Chay and Ollie decided that a bit of a workout was in order, and had a squat competition at 4800 metres and pull-ups back at base at 4500. Both will likely regret it tomorrow.</p>
