<p>Morning coffee, good breakfast<br />
Veggie meal at hippie restaurant<br />
Goodbyes<br />
Another harrowing journey to airport<br />
Flight to Pahkara with Jon, Sarah, Tony and Michaela<br />
Pahkara is amazing! Just what we needed.<br />
Excellent hotel, lake view.<br />
Sunny, clean, near a lake. Not as much traffic, actual pavement, no beggars, friendly locals. Basically not Kathmandu.<br />
Wander round in daze for a while.<br />
Bratwurst and good wine, lemon merrengue pie for tea</p>
