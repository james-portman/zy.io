<p>Not really got any content for here at the moment, but seeing as you're here, have some information.</p>
<p>This whole server is a mishmash of technologies at the moment.</p>
<p>This blog comes in through varnish, to an nginx backend with php-fpm and just standard MySQL.</p>
<p>Others on here go to an apache/passenger backend, with Sinatra running <a href="http://iptabl.es" target="_blank">some ruby junk for me </a>and others are just straight up LAMP.</p>
<p>It's all likely to change of course, it's very much a dev box with this as a bit of a public scratchpad for me.</p>
