<p>Over the last few days there had been all manner of mutterings about the upcoming flight back to Kathmandu. I was a bit unaware of this, but it seems that</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems our worries about flights were misplaced, we got the fourth flight out of Lukla with no issues.<br />
Not as scary as landing, but hurtling towards a cliff edge is a bit different<br />
Back in Kathmandu, we were too early to check in at hotel, so went for coffee.<br />
Everything is so cheap!<br />
Kathmandu is stressful and I'm not a big fan<br />
Ask Gelu about going to Pahkara or Chitwan<br />
He arranges it all in a few hours<br />
Monkey temple<br />
Meal with suspicious steak.<br />
Drinking in hotel<br />
Comfy bed, no sleeping bag!</p>
